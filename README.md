# PONG
Classic 2D Animated Paddle Ball Game

•	Recreated Pong from scratch using  C++, and the OpenGL API for graphics and animations

•	Implemented ball and paddle collisions with unique physics algorithms to intensify the challenge of the game 

•	Implemented an Artificial Intelligence module which makes use of random number generation and data interpolation to play against a human player

•	Built software architecture that makes the game very modifiable: Application can be easily redeveloped  to have more than one rendered ball or two rendered  paddles, or any other rendered objects
